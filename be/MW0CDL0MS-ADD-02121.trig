        :catalogInfo        "This manuscript is the only known copy of the Dhātupārāyaṇa of Pūrṇacandra, a commentary on the Dhātupāṭha of the Cāndravyākaraṇa, listing the verbal roots of the Sanskrit language accompanied by concise meaning entries. As noted by Liebich (1902), who used this manuscript for his edition of the Cāndra Dhātupāṭha, in the extant portion of the work the treatment of the roots of each of the ten verbal classes (gaṇas) is confined to the present tense, called with the artificial term laṭ in the Cāndra and Pāṇinian terminology. The term appears in fact in the section rubrics of the manuscript. Liebich also remarks that the commentary shows traces of the influence of other Dhātupāṭha traditions (Pāṇini and Kātantra) despite Pūrṇacandra’s affiliation to the Cāndra school, which is shown e.g. by the form of the pratyāhārasūtras found at the beginning of the work. The bundle also contains three additional folios, of seemingly related content, whose connection with the rest of the work is uncertain. The Dhātupārāyaṇa is as yet unpublished. According to Liebich (1895, p. 7) and, more recently, Verhagen (1994, p. 110 and 119), Pūrṇacandra’s work was known to the Tibetan grammatical tradition and was used by native translators of the Cāndra Dhātupāṭha. Nothing is known of Pūrṇacandra, but he is mentioned as the author of the Śabdalakṣaṇavivaraṇapañjikā, also unpublished, possibly a sub-commentary on the Cāndravyākaraṇapañjikā of Ratnamati (cf. Add.1657.1), which is preserved in a single 12th-century manuscript in the Kaiser Library in Kathmandu (see the online catalogue of NGMCP, reel no. C 82-7)."@en ;
